I am the founder and CEO of FutureFund Technology, a company that is on a mission to enrich the lives of students everywhere through fundraising and volunteering. With 25+ years of experience in web-based technologies and managing engineering teams, I know how to turn ideas into reality.

At FutureFund, we are at the forefront of reimagining fundraising for K-12 schools, creating a platform that is tailor-made to streamline and enhance the fundraising and selling experience, ensuring schools have the resources they need to thrive. I am also passionate about coaching and mentoring my team, as well as fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and social impact.
